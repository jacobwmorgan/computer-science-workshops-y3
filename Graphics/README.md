# Graphics Workshops - Year 3
Here are all the graphics workshops, completed & commented

In order to use these, you'll need to either use [ShaderToy]() for week 1 or [ShaderFrog]() for every week after that.

## ShaderToy
I've put everything inside a simple .glsl file, you can just copy this in and see how it works.. I decided this was better than uploading them directly to ShaderToy because GitHub is much more transparent about edits and changes.

## ShaderFrog
These are split into fragment.glsl and vertex.glsl, you'll need to copy these into ShaderFrog.. again, this isn't great, but I decided it was better to be transparent about edits.

## TODO
