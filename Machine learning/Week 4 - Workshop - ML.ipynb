    "In this workshop, you will use Python to implement the KNN (DO NOT use python libraries of KNN) introduced in the Lecture on the iris dataset. You will also be asked to use SVM algorithms available in scikit-learn to do classification on other datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iris dataset description\n",
    "The IRIS dataset is a good example of multi-classification. The dataset we will use has 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species, hence three classes: setosa, versicolor and virginica. There are four attributes in the data: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.\n",
    " \n",
    " The data can be loaded from `sklearn' using Python. \n",

    "Your code to implement KNN algorithm should include the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Load the data set; return 90% as train data and 10% as test data \n",
    "\n",
    "b. Normalize the features (why? because they are used for calculating distance, and KNN essentially rely on the single feature whose values are substantially larger)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Calculate the Euclidean distance between any two points\n",

    "d. Find the neighbours given a test data point and number k\n",

    "e. Get the class labels; you should also handle ties\n",

    "f. Calculate prediction accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you need to implement each function yourself instead of using python libraries. Please <font color='red'>try to avoid the train_test_split</font> function provided in sklearn. If you really do know how to shuffle data then just use it.\n"
